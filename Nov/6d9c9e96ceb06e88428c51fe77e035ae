A Sudanese opposition party says its leader has been arrested, bringing to at least 10 the number of senior opposition figures detained in the past two days. The head of the Sudanese Congress Party, Omar Al-Digair, was picked up by security forces at his home in Omdurman, near the capital Khartoum. Opposition parties have been calling for protests against last week's subsidy cuts which led to a 30 per cent increase in the price of fuel. There were deadly protests in Sudan three years ago when the government reduced fuel subsidies.   Conservationists say construction defied a court order halting the project. Regional bloc says its ready for action as reports of ceasefire violations rise.
