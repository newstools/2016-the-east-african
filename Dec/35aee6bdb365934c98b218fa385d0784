"Do you want help with the dishes? Martin Odero knew that the question to his wife Joanna sounded perfunctory. The last of their relatives, friends and colleagues, had just left their home. Martin knew they cared but he had had enough of awkwardly uttered, I m sorry , I know how you feel and If there s anything I can do, please let me know . Martin slumped on the sofa. His usually kind, brown eyes were weary and clouded with sadness as he looked around the living room. Everything reminded him of weekends spent with his 21-year-old daughter Tabitha during her time off from college. Martin worked hard as an investment banker and relished lazy weekends, when he, Joanna and Tabitha spent hours watching TV. Tabitha had saved Martin and Joanna s marriage. She was born after a struggle with infertility, made worse by Martin s family asking him to marry a second wife who would bear him children. How was Martin going to live without his daughter? Joanna looked at Martin, shrugged, and carried on with the dishes. She laid them on the dish rack and wiped the counters. All of a sudden, there was a flood of tears. She had been doing such a good job keeping herself together. But while cleaning up the kitchen, she had come across Tabitha s leather-bound notebook. And a searing pain broke down her defences. She sank to the floor and buried her head in her hands. Martin watched as sobs racked Joanna s frame. His mind told him to reach out to her, but the anger in his heart stopped him. Joanna looked up, and her glistening eyes met Martin s cold, black gaze before he turned and walked away. ************************* Things went awry one Saturday afternoon. Martin had found a movie that he thought Tabitha and Joanna would like. He took the movie into the living room, where Tabitha was. But something didn t seem right with her. Is something wrong, sweetheart? Martin asked, looking at his daughter with concern. She looked withdrawn, sitting on the floor in the corner. She was mumbling to herself and writing in her leather-bound notebook. He could hear the music from her iPod through her headphones. I m fine, Tabitha said. She looked up briefly, and went back to what she was doing. Tabitha, look at me. What s going on with you? "Do you want help with the dishes?
