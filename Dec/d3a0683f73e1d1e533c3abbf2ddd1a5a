Rwanda and Volkswagen South Africa are set to sign a deal to assemble vehicles in Kigali. The development will see the building of Rwanda’s first car production plant where the German automaker will assemble its Think Blue models. This will be the second such deal in East Africa. On Wednesday, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Volkswagen Polo Vivo fully-assembled in Kenya following a deal signed in September this year that allowed the carmaker to use the Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers (KVM) facility in Thika.
